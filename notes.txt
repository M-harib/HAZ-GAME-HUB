Team Contributions for the Project Implementation

Harib:

Harib played a pivotal role in setting up the foundation of the project by designing and implementing the login interface.

Login Interface:
Designed the user interface for the login page, ensuring a smooth user experience and logical flow for user authentication.
Developed the code for handling user inputs, validations (e.g., username and password requirements), and possible error handling for incorrect login attempts.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
Implemented the full functionality of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, including dark/light mode, player input logic, game rules, win/loss/draw conditions, and an intuitive interface for interaction.
Ensured the game's code was seamlessly integrated with the overall project structure, allowing smooth transition between the login system and game access.
Developed the algorithm to evaluate the outcomes by comparing the playerâ€™s choice (rock, paper, or scissors) with the computer-generated choice. The logic ensured accurate results based on the traditional game rules:


Ali:

Ali contributed significantly to the project by developing the Rock-Paper-Scissors game and introducing dynamic interactions using an external API.

Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:
Designed and implemented the rock paper scissors game's interface and core logic for determining outcomes based on player input versus computer-generated choices.
Enhanced the game experience by connecting it to an external API, which may have been used for generating randomized outcomes or providing statistical insights (e.g., global win rates or trends).
Focused on seamless integration of the API with the game logic, ensuring real-time data retrieval and smooth operation within the application.


Zohair:

Zohair contributed by creating the Memory Match game, adding a challenging and interactive component to the project.

Memory Match Game:
Designed the game interface, focusing on user engagement through appealing visuals and intuitive gameplay.
Developed the code for the game's mechanics, including card flipping, matching logic, and scoring system.
Worked on efficient algorithms to handle the game's performance, ensuring a responsive and smooth experience for users even as complexity increased.
Integrated the game into the overall application, maintaining consistency with the other components.


Summary

Each team member demonstrated their expertise and teamwork by taking ownership of specific components of the project. Harib laid the groundwork with the login system and contributed with Tic-Tac-Toe, Ali introduced interactive gaming through the Rock-Paper-Scissors API integration, and Zohair enhanced the project with the engaging Memory Match game. Together, these contributions created a cohesive and fully functional application.
